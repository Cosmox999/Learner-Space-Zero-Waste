## Project Name: Waste Container detection using Yolo

**Overview:** This project implements an object detection pipeline using the YOLOv8 model from the Ultralytics library. It includes setting up the environment, training on a custom dataset, and performing inference on test images and test video

### Workflow: 
1. **Installation:** Installed YOLOv8  
2. **Model Loading:** Loaded the pretrained YOLOv8 model from Ultralytics  
3. **Data Preparation:**
   - training and validation images
   - Setup directory structure and copied files accordingly
4. **Model Training:**
   - Trained YOLOv8 on a custom dataset
   - Adjusted parameters like batch size, epochs, and image size
5. **Inference:**
   - Performed predictions on new test images
   - Displayed and saved the results
